      <p>
        GraphAuth is a state-of-the-art authentication system that replaces traditional text-based passwords 
        with a secure, intuitive graphical pattern-based method. Our solution integrates OTP-based multi-factor 
        authentication and advanced brute-force protection, ensuring your account remains secure even in adverse conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Graphical Pattern Authentication:</strong> Users select a sequence of images as their password, 
          making it both memorable and hard to guess.</li>
        <li><strong>OTP-Based MFA:</strong> A one-time passcode is sent to your registered email, 
          adding an extra layer of security.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute-Force Protection:</strong> After repeated failed attempts, your account is temporarily 
          locked and you'll receive an alert email.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Technology Stack:</strong> Built with Go (Golang), MongoDB, and RESTful APIs, 
          GraphAuth is designed for scalability and robust security.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates advanced engineering practices in developing a production-ready, user-friendly 
        authentication system. Explore the features and see how modern security can be seamlessly integrated 
        into everyday applications.
